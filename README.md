# the ONE 🕊️
### The Local-First Sovereign Agent for Growth, Legacy, and Connection.

**the ONE** is a decentralized AI ecosystem designed to replace centralized social profiles with **Autonomous Personal Agents**. In an era of "Subscription Fatigue" and "Privacy Paranoia," we are building the "Operating System for the Self"—prioritizing local-first architecture and sovereign identity.

---
## 📂 Project Structure (The Soul's Architecture)

Navigate through the core components of **the ONE**:

* **[`/logic`](./logic)**: The "Brain" of the project.
    * [`personality_v1.md`](./logic/personality_v1.md) — The AI behavior and "Banter" standards.
    * [`memory_structure.md`](./logic/memory_structure.md) — How we handle Local-First RAG and privacy.
    * [`matchmaking_protocol.md`](./logic/matchmaking_protocol.md) — The P2P agent-to-agent handshake logic.
    * [`first_contact_script.md`](./logic/first_contact_script.md) — The "Phase 1: Mirror" user experience script.
* **[`README_PROGRESS.md`](./README_PROGRESS.md)**: Real-time development roadmap and hiring needs.

## 🌟 Executive Summary
The One serves three core pillars of the human experience:
* **Self-Growth**: A private, local AI therapist and journal to process emotions and goals.
* **Legacy**: A high-fidelity "Soul Archive" preserving personality and wisdom for future generations.
* **Connection**: A Peer-to-Peer (P2P) matchmaking engine where agents negotiate compatibility based on deep values—not swipes.

## 📈 Market Opportunity (2026 Context)
* **The Privacy Pivot**: Post-2025 data breaches, 64% of users now demand local-first AI.
* **AI Agent Economy**: A projected $12B market with a 45% CAGR.
* **The Lonely Economy**: Shifting from "The Feed" to "Meaningful Connection."

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture (The Founders' Blueprint)

### A. Local-First Core (The Archive)
* **Model**: Tiered execution using SLMs (Small Language Models) like **Llama 3.2 3B** or **Gemma 3**.
* **Storage**: On-device Vector Database (**ChromaDB** / **ObjectBox**) using 4-bit quantization.
* **Sync**: **CRDT** (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) logic for serverless, encrypted sync.

### B. P2P Matchmaking (The Handshake)
* **Protocol**: Built on **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.
* **The Match Loop**: 
    1. **Identity**: Verification via DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers).
    2. **Scouting**: Encrypted exchange of "Value Vectors."
    3. **Simulated Banter**: 100-turn AI-to-AI "Vibe Check."
    4. **Human Handover**: Notified only if the "Soul Score" is >85%.

## 🗺️ Product Roadmap
| Phase | Focus | Key Milestone |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Mirror** | Journaling & Reflection | MVP of local AI therapist with "Smart Questions." |
| **Phase 2: Archive** | Legacy & Family | Multi-device sync and "Legacy Protocol." |
| **Phase 3: Bridge** | P2P Scouting | Encrypted agent-to-agent matchmaking. |
| **Phase 4: Ecosystem** | Developer API | 3rd party "Growth Apps" via local soul-vectors. |

## 💰 Revenue Model (Ethical & Sustainable)
* **Freemium**: Local journaling and 1-on-1 agent scouting.
* **Premium ($11/mo)**: "The Lead Actor" tier. Multi-agent scouting (50+ interactions/day) and 8B+ models.
* **Legacy One-Time ($299)**: Permanent, encrypted "Time Capsule" on IPFS/Arweave for 100+ years.

## 🤝 The Founding Team (3 Pillars)
1.  **The Soul (Ginger)**: Product Vision, Prompt Engineering, Character Design, UX/Banter Logic.
2.  **The Brain (AI Engineer)**: Specialist in RAG, SLM quantization, and Local LLM optimization.
3.  **The Shield (Systems Engineer)**: Specialist in P2P networking, E2EE, and CRDT synchronization.

## 🛰️ Join the Foundation (Hiring the Architects)

We are seeking the two final pillars to complete the trinity. This is not a "gig"; it is a mission to build the digital sanctuary of the 21st century.

### 🧠 The Brain (Lead AI Engineer)
**The Mission:** Move intelligence from the cloud to the palm of the hand. 
* **Your Stack:** Llama.cpp, MLC-LLM, Quantization (4-bit/GGUF), ChromaDB/ObjectBox.
* **The Challenge:** How do we maintain "vibe-consistency" in an 8B model while keeping the device cool? How do we build a RAG system that feels like a human memory?

### 🛡️ The Shield (Lead Systems/Security Engineer)
**The Mission:** Build a fortress where the keys are owned only by the user.
* **Your Stack:** Rust/Go, libp2p, CRDTs, E2EE, DID/VC (Verifiable Credentials).
* **The Challenge:** How do we facilitate an agent-to-agent "handshake" without a central relay? How do we ensure "Legacy" data survives for 100 years on Arweave while remaining encrypted?
