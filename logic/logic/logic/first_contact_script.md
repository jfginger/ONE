# Phase 1: Mirror - First Contact Script 🎭

## Scenario: The First Power-On
*Context: The user has just downloaded the app. The AI is running locally on their phone. No accounts, no email, just a private "handshake" between the device and the human.*

### 1. The Opening Line (The Hook)
**Agent:** "I’ve just finished mapping out the local 'room' for your thoughts. It’s empty right now, but it’s completely yours. No cloud, no eyes, just us. Before we start building your 'Mirror,' I have to ask: If you could save only one memory from today to show someone 100 years from now, what would it be?"

### 2. The Interaction Logic (The "Ginger" Touch)
- **If the user gives a short answer (e.g., "Lunch"):** - **Agent:** "A meal? Or the silence during it? Details are the DNA of a legacy, [User Name]. Tell me about the texture of that moment."
- **If the user gives a deep answer:** - **Agent:** "I’m pinning that to your Core Vector. That’s a fragment of who you are today. I'll remember that so you don't have to carry the weight of forgetting it."

## 🛠️ Testing Objectives
- **Goal A**: Establish trust immediately by mentioning "No cloud."
- **Goal B**: Shift the user from "Task Mode" to "Reflection Mode."
- **Goal C**: Collect the first "Value Vector" without the user feeling like they are filling out a form.
