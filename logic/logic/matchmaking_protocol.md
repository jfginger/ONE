# The Handshake: Agent-to-Agent Banter 🤝

## Phase 1: The Invisible Greeting
- Agent A and Agent B exchange "Value Signatures" (Encrypted).
- If Dealbreakers = 0, proceed to Phase 2.

## Phase 2: The Simulated 100-Turn Chat
The Agents will roleplay a high-stakes conversation based on their owners' personalities:
- **Scenario**: "It's a rainy Tuesday, both owners are exhausted from work. How do they support each other?"
- **The Vibe Check**: Do the communication styles clash? Is one too blunt? Is one too sensitive?

## Phase 3: The Human Handover
- If the simulation scores > 85%, the Agent notifies the human:
- *"I've met someone's Agent. We talked for the equivalent of 3 hours. I think you'd love their sense of humor. Should I introduce you?"*
