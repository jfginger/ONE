# The Archive: Local Memory Logic 🧠

## 1. What to Remember (The Soul Vector)
- **Core Values**: Not just "hobbies," but how the user makes hard decisions.
- **Emotional Baselines**: How the user sounds when happy vs. burnt out.
- **Legacy Nuggets**: Stories the user tells more than twice (flagged for the "Soul Archive").

## 2. The "Forget-Me-Not" Filter
- The User can say "Forget this" to nuking a specific memory vector permanently.
- **Privacy Rule**: No data leaves the local device. Syncing via CRDT must be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE).

## 3. Smart Retrieval
- Instead of a search bar, the user asks: "Why did I feel this way last October?"
- The Agent uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to connect the dots.
